# Slop Sentry Plugins

Public repository hosting the Claude plugin packages, marketplace catalog, and distribution artifacts for [Slop Sentry](https://slopsentry.ai).

Slop Sentry checks writing drafts for thin claims, try-hard or hokey language, and AI-generated writing tells, then delivers polished, human-sounding revisions. This repository provides the public packaging and marketplace manifests required for Claude Code, Claude Cowork, and MCP-compatible environments without bundling proprietary backend engine sources.

### What Each Directory Contains

- **`claude-marketplace/`**: The Claude marketplace catalog. It defines the marketplace structure and points to the `slop-sentry` plugin inside `plugins/slop-sentry`.
- **`claude-marketplace/plugins/slop-sentry/`**: The plugin source directory submitted to the Claude plugin directory. It includes:
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Plugin description, version, and author metadata.
  - `.mcp.json`: Configures the remote MCP endpoint (`https://mcp.slopsentry.ai`).
  - `skills/slop-sentry`: The primary workflow skill for drafting, editing, quality checks, substance checks, hokiness checks, and visual diff reviews.
  - `skills/install-slop-sentry`: Setup instructions for connecting the MCP server to supported local and desktop clients.
- **`dist/`**: Pre-built distribution archives. `slop-sentry-claude.zip` is ready for direct upload to Claude Cowork environments where custom marketplace URLs are not configured.

## Installation

### Claude Code

To add the local marketplace and install the plugin in Claude Code:

```bash
# Add the marketplace catalog
claude plugin marketplace add claude-marketplace

# Install the Slop Sentry plugin
claude plugin install slop-sentry@slop-sentry --scope user
```

To validate the plugin directory prior to submission or installation:

```bash
claude plugin validate claude-marketplace/plugins/slop-sentry
```

### Direct MCP Connection (Claude Code)

If you prefer connecting directly to the remote MCP server without installing the plugin package:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http slop-sentry https://mcp.slopsentry.ai
```

> **Note:** The `--transport http` flag is required. Without it, Claude Code interprets the URL as a local executable command.

### Claude Cowork

1. **Direct Upload:** Upload `dist/slop-sentry-claude.zip` directly through the Cowork plugin interface.
2. **Directory Listing:** Once published in the public directory, install Slop Sentry from the directory catalog.
3. **Custom MCP Connector:** If plugin installations are restricted by your workspace administrator, configure a custom connector under **Workspace Settings > Connectors > Add Custom MCP** with the URL `https://mcp.slopsentry.ai`.

## Authentication & Privacy
